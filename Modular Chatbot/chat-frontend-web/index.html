                I am the detective chat bot designed to interrogate you about the armed robbery happened few days back
                at a spatkauf near Berliner Strasse. I am responsible for its investigation, so I am going to ask you
                some questions to come up with a decision. It will include, what I have investigated so far. Also you
                can have general conversation with me like you can ask me to talk about general stuff with you, about
                corona virus and its stats, to make you laugh, to do gossips, how do I feel, who am I, what do I eat
                and other related questions about me. You can switch between the topics at any moment as I am designed
                for parallel handling of the multiple topics. Kindly, chat at least with me until I reach any decision
                or say you goodbye before you jump to completion of the surveys. Thanks!
