\chapter{Experiments and Evaluations\label{cha:chapter4}}

To evaluate the Frankenbot's modular architecture on the basis of the user experience, the surveys has been conducted. 
\\~\\
For accomplishment of this research, random users were selected irrespective of their profession, studies background and any race or gender discrimination. But the age limit constraint was set to be above 18. As participants were considered to be accused of a robbery and have to chat with a detective bot and answer his questions which can be a bit rude and straight forward for youngsters below 18. So the participant with the minimum age was 22. On contrary, the one with the maximum age was 34. And the average age calculated as 25.65 with the standard deviation of 2.37. Visuals have been shown in the Figure \ref{fig:ageGraph}.

Total 20 users participated in this study. Most of them appeared to be from technical background as maximum of them were students from different universities. Secondly, majority of participants revealed themselves to be IT employees other than the students. While remaining revealed themselves as engineer, teacher and business qualified. More details have been shown in the Figure \ref{fig:profGraph}.

\section{Experimental Setup}
This research study has been conducted to gather the results for what user has experienced while interacting with the chatbot. 
\\~\\
The users were asked to complete two surveys. One named as "Frankenbot's Experience Survey" was designed with the help of \cite{MOLLER200726}\cite{itut}. For the second survey, the standardized tool to personally evaluate the usability and design of an interactive product known as AttrakDiff\cite{attrakdiff} has been used. First survey was designed using Google Forms and the purpose of it was to capture the user's interaction experience about the Frankenbot. While, the purpose of AttrakDiff's study was to evaluate the Frankenbot's hedonic(joy of use, stimulation, identification) and pragmatic(usefulness, efficiency, easy to use) qualities. 
\\~\\
The users were provided with the link to the deployed chatbot's interface as a web page and they can easily access it from their own places. It provided ease to the user and enhanced the comfortability factor for them. Also, they have to read the description and instructions provided for them on the web page. And they have to figure out what to do and how to operate the chatbot on their own without any external help. Which has given more realistic and unbiased essence to the results obtained.
\\~\\
For the surveys, the web page contains the heading as "Frankenbot's Request" in which the users were requested to complete the surveys once, they are finished having chat for a fun purpose with the chatbot. They have been provided with the links to the surveys.
\\~\\
The surveys were conducted in English language. Whereas, AttrakDiff's survey has the option for both English and German. You can find the "Frankenbot's Experience Survey" in the Appendices \ref{appen:survey}. Furthermore, AttrakDiff's Individual Evaluation Study\cite{indeval} has been used as the second survey.
\\~\\
The questionnaire gets completed on individuals devices. As link to the deployed chatbot has been shared with them using different social platforms along with an introductory text about the purpose of the study. When the user was interacting with the chatbot all communication was getting stored in the log file for the future records and usage.

\subsection{Frankenbot's Experience Survey}
The questionnaire itself has been divided in to the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users overall impression about the interaction with the chatbot.
    \item Familiarity of the user with the already existing chatbots.
    \item Whether the user succeeded to achieve the desired goals.
    \item How was the communication with the chatbot.
    \item What was the behaviour of the chatbot with the users.
    \item How well the dialogue was designed.
    \item Personal impression and experience of the user about the chatbot.
    \item Users opinion about the chatbot's usefulness and user friendliness. 
\end{itemize}
